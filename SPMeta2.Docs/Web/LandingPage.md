SPMeta2 is a hassle-free fluent API for code-based SharePoint artefact provisioning.
It offers a consistent provisioning API via SSOM/CSOM for SharePoin 2010, 2013 and O365.

SPMeta2 is all you need to have a **testable**, **repeatable** and **upgradable** way to provision fields, content types, lists, list views, webs, 
custom actions, security groups, permission levels, web parts, wiki pages, web part pages, publishing pages and so on - in fact, 
**more than 100 (sic, more than a hundred) different artifacts** and **even more scenarios**.

Sounds exciting? Have a look around, let us know how it goes.
