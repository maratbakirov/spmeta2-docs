SPMeta2 is an open source project driven and cured by [SubPoint Solutions](http://subpointsolutions.com) team.
Having said that, we appreciate all the contributions by the community from a small suggestion to the pull request at GITHUB. 

## Releases schedule 

The SPMeta2 library is being actively developed: new features, enhancements and fixes are constantly added. 
We tend to be agile and deliver new features and fixes as soon as possible:

* On weekly basis new features and minor fixes are published as -beta to NuGet
* On monthly basis a major release is published to NuGet

## Planning and feature requiests
We tend to use scrum and weekly iterations, aligning our roadmap with the comnunity using the following channels:

* [UserVoice](https://subpointsolutions.uservoice.com)
* [SPMeta2 Yammer network](https://www.yammer.com/spmeta2feedback) 

Once we deside on the features, we use [GITHUB issues](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2/issues) to plan and track iterations.
## Source code

We use GITHUB to host the source code - both dev/master branches could be found here:

* [SPMeta2 dev branch](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2/tree/dev)
* [SPMeta2 master branch](https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/spmeta2/tree/master)
